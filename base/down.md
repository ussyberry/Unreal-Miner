# Muon Imagery (Subsurface Detection)

## Overview
Muon imaging technology penetrates deep underground structures, revealing hidden chambers and voids - the "down" equivalent of space remote sensing for archaeological and geological applications.

## Key Technologies

### Cosmic-Ray Muon Imaging
- **Principle**: Uses naturally occurring cosmic ray muons that penetrate deep into materials
- **Detection**: Measures muon absorption rates to create density maps
- **Resolution**: Can detect voids as small as 2-3 meters in size

### Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR)
- **Electromagnetic Waves**: Sends radio waves into the ground
- **Reflection Analysis**: Detects reflections from different material interfaces
- **Depth Penetration**: Effective up to 50+ meters depending on soil conditions

### Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT)
- **Electrical Resistance**: Measures how well electrical current flows through subsurface materials
- **3D Mapping**: Creates 3D models of subsurface structures
- **Material Differentiation**: Distinguishes between different types of rock and construction materials

### Seismic Tomography
- **Wave Propagation**: Uses seismic waves to map subsurface structures
- **Velocity Analysis**: Different materials transmit waves at different speeds
- **High Resolution**: Provides detailed structural information
