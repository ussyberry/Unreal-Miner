# GitHub Issue: Tracking for PRD v1.0

**Title:** `Tracking Issue for Product Requirements Document (PRD) v1.0`

---

**Body:**

This issue tracks the implementation of the features and goals outlined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) v1.0.

## Vision
Democratize mineral exploration by providing AI-powered geological analysis tools that reduce exploration costs by 90% and time-to-insight from months to minutes.

**Core Value Proposition:** *"From coordinates to 3D mineral exploration in 10 minutes"*

This issue will serve as a living document to track progress against the PRD. The full PRD should be consulted for detailed requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
